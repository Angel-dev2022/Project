        Finland is famous for being the Happiest Country in the World, as well
        as having the world's best education system and cleanest air. Finland is
        known for its saunas, reindeers, Nokia, and the Santa Claus village.
        This Nordic utopia is sometimes called the Country of a Thousand Lakes,
        and it's got 187,888 of them.

          Helsinki is well-known for its innovative art, culture and
          architecture, so it's no surprise that underneath the city's surface,
          a unique subculture is on the rise. And while techno music and
          underground dance parties are nothing new for Helsinki, what is
          notable is the vast number and variety of these events.<br />Helsingfors
          is the original name of the modern city of Helsinki, and is still the
          official Swedish name for the city.

          Porvoo is the second oldest city in Finland that is best known for its
          Old Wooden Town, charming cafés and boutiques, and the painted
          red-ochre riverside warehouses. The cobbled streets lined with old
          dollhouse-like houses are embedded with excellent restaurants,
          handcraft and homeware shops, and galleries.

          Founded almost 800 hundred years ago, Turku is the oldest city and the
          former capital of Finland. The city takes pride in its long cultural
          history and relevance as a gateway to the west. The lively city has
          been said to have the soul of a metropolis in a body of a small town.

          Lapland is the northern-most region of Finland and an active outdoor
          destination that's known for its incredible, year-round light
          phenomena, vast artic nature, and Santa Claus. The land of the
          indigenous Sámi people, known as Sámiland or Sápmi, also crosses the
          northern part of the region.<br />One of the main reasons people come
          to Lapland in winter is because we're home of the most famous holiday
          icon of all time: the Easter Bunny. Just kidding, of course. Lapland
          is the home of the real Santa Claus, with his secret workshop under
          Korvatunturi Mountain, and his hometown in Rovaniemi.
